# ROLI Seaboard Implementation Guide

## Physical Layout and Design

The ROLI Seaboard features a revolutionary design that reimagines the traditional keyboard:

- **Continuous Surface**: Made of elastic silicone material that forms a seamless playing surface
- **Keywaves**: Instead of traditional piano keys, the Seaboard has raised "keywaves" that correspond to the white and black keys of a piano
- **Form Factors**: Available in multiple models including Seaboard 2, Seaboard BLOCK M, and Seaboard Rise
- **Size Range**: Various models offer between 24 to 49 keys
- **Construction**: Features durable materials including aluminum chassis for stability and longevity
- **Frets**: Includes precision frets for enhanced control and note placement

## Touch-Sensitive Surface Technology

The Seaboard's core innovation is its responsive touch surface that captures multiple dimensions of touch:

- **Continuous Touch Surface**: Unlike traditional keyboards with discrete keys, the Seaboard allows continuous movement across its surface
- **Pressure Sensitivity**: The surface responds to varying degrees of pressure throughout a note's duration
- **Multi-Touch Capability**: Allows for simultaneous control of multiple notes with independent expression
- **Elastic Response**: The silicone surface provides tactile feedback and returns to shape after being pressed

## The Five Dimensions of Touch (5D Touch)

The Seaboard captures five distinct dimensions of touch, each controlling different aspects of sound:

1. **Strike**: The initial velocity or force with which a keywave is pressed
   - Controls the attack and initial volume of a note
   - Similar to traditional keyboard velocity sensitivity but with greater precision

2. **Press**: Continuous pressure applied after the initial strike
   - Controls timbre, volume, or other parameters during sustained notes
   - Enables dynamic expression throughout a note's duration

3. **Glide**: Horizontal movement from side to side across keywaves
   - Enables pitch bending and vibrato effects
   - Allows for seamless transitions between notes (portamento)
   - Creates microtonal expressions not possible on traditional keyboards

4. **Slide**: Vertical movement up and down on each keywave
   - Often mapped to timbre variations or filter controls
   - Provides another dimension of expression per note

5. **Lift**: How the finger releases from the keywave
   - Controls the release characteristics of a note
   - Affects how a note ends or transitions

## Sound Modulation Through Touch

The Seaboard translates physical gestures into sound modulation through:

- **MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression)**: Each note is assigned its own MIDI channel, allowing for independent expression of simultaneously played notes
- **Real-time Parameter Control**: Each dimension of touch can be mapped to different sound parameters
- **Continuous Control**: Parameters change fluidly rather than in discrete steps
- **Independent Note Expression**: Each note can have its own unique expression path, unlike traditional keyboards where expression controls affect all notes

## Distinctive Features for Web Implementation

Key considerations for implementing a web-based version:

- **Visual Feedback**: The physical Seaboard provides visual cues through its raised keywaves; a web version should include clear visual indicators for note positions
- **Pressure Visualization**: Consider implementing visual feedback that represents pressure intensity
- **Glide Paths**: Visualize the path of finger movement across the surface
- **Multi-Touch Support**: Ensure the interface can handle multiple simultaneous touch points with independent expression
- **Latency Minimization**: Focus on reducing input lag for responsive performance
- **Adaptive Layout**: Design the interface to work across different screen sizes and touch capabilities
- **Sound Engine Integration**: Develop a sound engine that can respond to the multiple dimensions of control

## Technical Implementation Considerations

- **Touch Event Handling**: Capture and process complex touch events including pressure (where supported)
- **Gesture Recognition**: Implement algorithms to distinguish between different types of movements
- **Parameter Mapping**: Create flexible mapping between touch dimensions and sound parameters
- **Visual Design**: Balance visual aesthetics with functional clarity for the playing surface
- **Accessibility**: Consider alternative control methods for users without touch screens

## Sound Design Implications

- **Continuous Controllers**: Sound generators need to respond to continuous control changes
- **Polyphonic Expression**: Each voice needs independent modulation capabilities
- **Timbre Morphing**: Implement smooth transitions between different timbres based on touch
- **Realistic Instrument Modeling**: Consider physical modeling synthesis to achieve realistic instrument behaviors

This implementation guide provides the foundation for creating a web-based version of the ROLI Seaboard that captures its innovative approach to musical expression through touch.
