## 1. Touch Pressure Sensitivity in Web Applications

### Current Capabilities and Limitations
- Web Audio API does not have native, comprehensive touch pressure detection
- Touch events API exists but requires custom integration with audio synthesis
- Implementation requires combining Touch Events API with Web Audio API

### Technical Approach
- Use Touch Events API to capture basic touch interactions
- Implement custom JavaScript to map touch pressure to audio parameters
- Consider using Pointer Events API for more advanced touch tracking
- Develop pressure mapping algorithms for expressive control

### Browser Compatibility
- Touch pressure detection support varies across browsers
- Implement feature detection before using pressure-sensitive features
- Develop fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited touch support

## 2. JavaScript Audio Synthesis Libraries

### Recommended Libraries

#### Tone.js
- Web Audio framework designed for interactive music in browsers
- Provides high-level, musician-friendly API
- Well-suited for complex synthesizer implementation
- Offers extensive documentation and examples

#### Flocking.js
- Creative audio synthesis framework for artists and musicians
- Supports experimental web-based sound projects
- Good for specialized sound design requirements

#### js-synthesizer
- Generates audio data using WebAssembly
- Uses FluidSynth as a core synthesizer engine
- Provides low-level audio synthesis capabilities

### Implementation Strategy
1. Use Tone.js as the primary synthesis engine
2. Implement custom pressure mapping with Pointer/Touch Events
3. Leverage Web Audio API for low-level sound generation
4. Consider WebAssembly for performance-critical audio processing

## 3. Multi-Touch Events and Pressure Detection

### HTML5 Touch Events API
- Supports multiple simultaneous touch points
- Defined by W3C Touch Events specification (Level 2)
- Provides events for touchstart, touchmove, touchend, and touchcancel

### Pressure Detection Implementation
```javascript
// Basic multi-touch pressure detection template
element.addEventListener('touchstart', (event) => {
  const touches = event.touches;
  for (let i = 0; i < touches.length; i++) {
    // Check for pressure if supported
    const pressure = touches[i].force || 0.5; // Fallback value
    // Process touch with pressure
  }
});
```

### Enhanced Pressure Detection
- Consider using Pressure.js library
  - Handles multiple fingers simultaneously
  - Supports different force levels on screen
  - Provides cross-browser polyfill for pressure detection

### Challenges and Solutions
- Inconsistent pressure detection across devices
- Solution: Implement calibration mechanism for different devices
- Limited native browser support for granular pressure sensitivity
- Solution: Use polyfill libraries and custom pressure mapping

## 4. Web Audio API for Expressive Synthesizers

### Core Capabilities
- AudioContext as the primary interface
- Node-based audio processing system
- Support for complex audio routing and processing

### Synthesizer-Specific Features
1. **Oscillator Manipulation**
   - Support for generating different waveforms
   - Control over frequency, amplitude, and wave type
   - Custom oscillator types possible

2. **Sound Envelope Control**
   - ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope implementation
   - Fine-grained control over sound characteristics
   - Example implementation:
   ```javascript
   // Simple ADSR envelope
   function createEnvelope(audioContext, attackTime, decayTime, sustainLevel, releaseTime) {
     const envelope = audioContext.createGain();
     const now = audioContext.currentTime;
     
     // Attack
     envelope.gain.setValueAtTime(0, now);
     envelope.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, now + attackTime);
     
     // Decay to sustain level
     envelope.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(sustainLevel, now + attackTime + decayTime);
     
     // Release happens on note off
     
     return envelope;
   }
   ```

3. **Advanced Audio Effects**
   - Filters (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, etc.)
   - Delay and echo effects
   - Modulation capabilities (vibrato, tremolo)

### Expressive Control Mapping
- Map touch pressure to amplitude, filter cutoff, or other parameters
- Use continuous controllers for expressive playing
- Implement MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) concepts in web audio

## 5. Audio Recording and Export Methods

### Browser-Based Recording Techniques
- Use MediaRecorder API for capturing audio output
- Example implementation:
```javascript
// Basic audio recording setup
function setupRecording(audioContext, sourceNode) {
  const destination = audioContext.createMediaStreamDestination();
  sourceNode.connect(destination);
  
  const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(destination.stream);
  const audioChunks = [];
  
  mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
    audioChunks.push(event.data);
  };
  
  mediaRecorder.onstop = () => {
    const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: 'audio/wav' });
    const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
    // Create download link or further processing
  };
  
  return mediaRecorder;
}
```

### Export Formats
- WAV: Lossless audio, larger file size
- MP3: Compressed audio, smaller file size
- Consider using libraries like lamejs for MP3 encoding in the browser

### User Experience Considerations
- Provide visual feedback during recording
- Implement playback before export
- Offer multiple export format options
